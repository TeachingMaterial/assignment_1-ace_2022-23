USING WEBSOCKETS
To use WebSockets to transfer JSON data from a mobile phone to a server, the following steps can be followed:

Set up a WebSocket server: The first step is to set up a WebSocket server on the server side that can receive and send data over a WebSocket connection.
Establish a WebSocket connection: Next, the mobile app must establish a WebSocket connection with the server using a WebSocket library such as OkHttp or Netty.
Serialize JSON data: On the mobile side, the JSON data must be serialized into a string or byte format so that it can be sent over the WebSocket connection.
Send JSON data: Once the connection is established and the data is serialized, it can be sent to the server using the WebSocket’s ‘send()’ method.
Deserialize JSON data: On the server side, the received data must be deserialized back into a JSON format so that it can be processed and stored.
Close the WebSocket connection: Finally, when the data transfer is complete, the WebSocket connection should be closed.
